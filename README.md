# Opensource Commons
----

The Opensource Commons is a project built by [Software for Good](http://www.softwareforgood.com) which helps organizations move their communication online. Built using [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) and [Buddypress](http://www.buddypress.org) (plus many more plugins) the Commons is relatively simple to setup with some familiarity with those tools.

## Installation & Setup
This project assumes some familiarity with setting up a [Wordpress site](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress). 

The only code checked into the repository in the `wp-content` directory containing plugins and themes and a default database with some basic plugin configuration and pages to get up and running quickly. I also highly recommend using [wp-cli](http://wp-cli.org/) to make your wordpress life a little easier. 

###To get running locally
* Copy this project
* Create your database
* Import the starter database
* create your new project directory and `cd` into it
* (with wp-cli) run `wp core download`
* (with wp-cli)
